One can use `dbus-send` or [playerctl](https://github.com/acrisci/playerctl) to control MPRIS supported
media players. However, there is already plenty of resources on how to do that. In this post, I mainly
want to highlight [net-mpris](https://github.com/ritiek/net-mpris), a tool which I recently wrote.
Actually, I only wrote a small part of it and the rest of the code got re-used from [mps-youtube](https://github.com/mps-youtube/mps-youtube)
with some minor adjustments. Net-mpris mainly fools the client machine in a way as if the remote media player
is simply running on the client machine itself. It does this by simply forwarding data to-and-fro the remote
machine and the local machine. It allows for some pretty cool things - you can use the sound applet or media
function keys on your keyboard to control the playback.

I have a headless Raspberry Pi connected to speakers and I've been using [mps-youtube](https://github.com/mps-youtube/mps-youtube)
to play music on it through SSH. This has been working quite well but has got me frustrated to switch terminals
everytime I wish to do simple stuff such as pause music, or play the next track in the playlist on the remotely
running instance of mps-youtube. I thought about creating net-mpris to make the experience a little less
frustrating, and it does indeed for the most part.

Here it is in action!
