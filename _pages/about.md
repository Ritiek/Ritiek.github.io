Hello! My name is Ritiek Malhotra.

I am 17 years old and a freshmen. I spend most of my time tinkering with electronics and writing code.

I began coding at the age of 10. Those days were nothing more than a couple if-then statements in BASIC. Later on, I began writing small automation tools in [AutoIT](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/) to gain advantage in online-gaming. Oh, did I even mention I played computer games all day?
It wasn't until I turned 15, I somehow got myself a Raspberry Pi and got serious with code. No one around me had much experience with programming, so I had to learn all the good stuff on my own. I completely shifted from playing computer games to playing with silicon. For some reason, I found it more engaging than gaming. It felt amazing to know about technologies like SSH, when nobody even used linux, hehe. I remember myself shutting down my Pi (which light up the red LED) via SSH to confirm the commands I wrote via SSH really did work. I would be eager to return home from school just so that I could mess more.

The first major language I started coding in was Python. I wouldn't use functions or make an effort to write efficient code and most of my code involved system calls which were very platform dependant. It was unbelievably hard for anyone to read whatever I wrote, myself included. Check out [this blob of code](https://github.com/ritiek/spotify-downloader/blob/b473f8f3cd0f7f2b00cd39a4eb8f907264162ce0/YTMusic.py) from July in 2016, I can hear you giggling already. It belongs to an open-source tool called [spotify-downloader](https://github.com/ritiek/spotify-downloader) I began working on with no more than a week experience in Python. It got better eventually. Working with open-source made me become aware of some commonly used coding-practices in the developer community and helped me write some capable code. It still helps me gain new knowledge whilst I collaborate with other developers to build tools. So, heil open-source!

Later on, I wrote a couple more projects in Python. As I got comfortable with Python and programming in general, I worked on small projects in other languages like Bash, Rust, JavaScript to name a few. I came to realize that I really enjoy working with open-source. I now a spend part of my free-time learning more about stuff like neural networks and functional programming languages.
