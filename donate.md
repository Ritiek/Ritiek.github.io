If you've made it this far, you probably like me. :)

I wish to help open-source as much as possible but since I'm a college student and unfortunately
with limited savings, I'll have to find a job to pay my bills sooner or later.

That is, unless I find a way to live off through my open-source work. If my work has helped you
in any way, I'll be happy if you would like to show appreciation by tossing me a coin and you could
help me fuel my attention towards open-source! Cheers.
